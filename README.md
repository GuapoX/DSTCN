# DSTCN

Dust detection plays an important role in the management of port terminals. In this study, we propose a novel Dust Detection Spatio-Temporal Correlation Network (DSTCN) in complex harbor environments. The proposed
model integrates a Dust Localization Module (DLM) and a Fault Eliminating Module (FEM) to improve detection accuracy while reducing false alarms and misclassifications. We train and test DSTCN on a dataset containing
dust and spray in real scenarios, which includes 3,089 images and 100 video
sequences. The experimental results show that DSTCN achieves an average
precision of 72.9% in identifying dust at port terminals, with a detection
speed of 56.2 frames per second (FPS). In addition, the efficiency of DSTCN
is further evaluated through a comparative analysis with other network models, which show that DSTCN serves as a powerful tool for detecting dynamic
non-rigid objects.
